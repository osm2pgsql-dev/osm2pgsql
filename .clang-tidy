#  android-cloexec-*
#    O_CLOEXEC isn't available on Windows
#
#  boost-use-ranges
#    Not applicable, we don't want to rely on more code from boost.
#
#  bugprone-chained-comparison
#    Triggerd by the Catch library in many places.
#
#  bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters
#    Can't always be avoided.
#
#  cert-err58-cpp
#    There are many of these in the test code, most of them from the Catch
#    framework. Difficult to avoid.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-avoid-do-while (new in clang-tidy-16)
#    Its a good idea to avoid them when there are better alternatives, but
#    sometimes they are the cleanest alternative.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-avoid-magic-numbers
#  readability-magic-numbers
#    We have a lot of these and should probably at least fix some. But remove
#    it for the time being because with it we can't see the forest for the
#    trees. (TODO)
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-avoid-non-const-global-variables
#    Not wrong to avoid those, but we have a few that are hard to avoid.
#    Also this warning is triggered many times by constructs in the Catch test
#    framework.

#
#  fuchsia-*
#    Very specific and way too strict
#
#  google-readability-todo
#    We are not that organized
#
#  llvmlibc-*
#    Not applicable
#
#  misc-include-cleaner (new in clang-tidy-17)
#    Many instances of this warning, disabled for now. (TODO)
#
#  misc-no-recursion
#    Nothing wrong with recursion
#
#  modernize-use-nodiscard
#    Doesn't really make the code clearer if it is all littered with
#    [[nodiscard]]. Looks like this warning is more suited for a library
#    than for normal code.
#
#  modernize-use-trailing-return-type
#    We are not that modern...
#
#  readability-identifier-length
#    Generally not a bad idea, but there are many cases where short names
#    for (local) vars are okay.
#
#  readability-implicit-bool-conversion
#    Readability is a matter of opinion here
