# osm2pgsql

https://osm2pgsql.org

osm2pgsql is a tool for loading OpenStreetMap data into a PostgreSQL / PostGIS
database suitable for applications like rendering into a map, geocoding with
Nominatim, or general analysis.

See the [documentation](https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/) for instructions on how
to install and run osm2pgsql.

## Features

* Converts OSM files to a PostgreSQL DB
* Conversion of tags to columns is configurable in the style file
* Able to read .gz, .bz2, .pbf and .o5m files directly
* Can apply diffs to keep the database up to date
* Support the choice of output projection
* Configurable table names
* Support for hstore field type to store the complete set of tags in one database
  field if desired

## Installing

Most Linux distributions include osm2pgsql. It is available on macOS with
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and Windows builds are also available. See
https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/install.html for details.

## Building

The latest source code is available in the osm2pgsql git repository on GitHub
and can be downloaded as follows:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql.git
```

Osm2pgsql uses the cross-platform [CMake build system](https://cmake.org/)
to configure and build itself.

Required libraries are

* [expat](https://libexpat.github.io/)
* [proj](https://proj.org/)
* [bzip2](http://www.bzip.org/)
* [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/)
* [Boost libraries](https://www.boost.org/), including geometry, system and
  filesystem
* [CImg](https://cimg.eu/) (Optional, see README-gen.md)
* [potrace](https://potrace.sourceforge.net/) (Optional, see README-gen.md)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) client libraries
* [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) (Optional, used for Lua tag transforms
  and the flex output)
* [Python](https://python.org/) (only for running tests)
* [Psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org/) (only for running tests)

The following libraries are included in the `contrib` directory. You can build
with other versions of those libraries (set the `EXTERNAL_*libname*` option to
`ON`) but make sure you are using a compatible version:

* [fmt](https://fmt.dev/) (>= 7.1.3)
* [libosmium](https://osmcode.org/libosmium/) (>= 2.17.0)
* [protozero](https://github.com/mapbox/protozero) (>= 1.6.3)

It also requires access to a database server running
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 9.6+ and
[PostGIS](https://www.postgis.net/) 2.2+.

Make sure you have installed the development packages for the libraries
mentioned in the requirements section and a C++ compiler which supports C++17.
We officially support gcc >= 7.0 and clang >= 8.

To rebuild the included man page you'll need the [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
tool.

First install the dependencies.

On a Debian or Ubuntu system, this can be done with:

```sh
sudo apt-get install make cmake g++ libboost-dev libboost-system-dev \
  libboost-filesystem-dev libexpat1-dev zlib1g-dev libpotrace-dev cimg-dev \
  libbz2-dev libpq-dev libproj-dev lua5.3 liblua5.3-dev pandoc
```

On a Fedora system, use

```sh
sudo dnf install cmake make gcc-c++ boost-devel expat-devel zlib-devel \
  potrace-devel cimg-devel \
  bzip2-devel postgresql-devel proj-devel proj-epsg lua-devel pandoc
```

On RedHat / CentOS first run `sudo yum install epel-release` then install
dependencies with:

```sh
sudo yum install cmake make gcc-c++ boost-devel expat-devel zlib-devel \
  bzip2-devel postgresql-devel proj-devel proj-epsg lua-devel pandoc
```

On a FreeBSD system, use

```sh
pkg install devel/cmake devel/boost-libs textproc/expat2 \
  databases/postgresql94-client graphics/proj lang/lua52
```

On Alpine, use

```sh
apk --update-cache add cmake make g++ boost-dev expat-dev \
  bzip2-dev zlib-dev libpq proj-dev lua5.3-dev postgresql-dev
```

Once dependencies are installed, use CMake to build the Makefiles in a separate
folder:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
```

If some installed dependencies are not found by CMake, more options may need
to be set. Typically, setting `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to a list of appropriate
paths is sufficient.

When the Makefiles have been successfully built, compile with

```sh
make
```

The man page can be rebuilt with:

```sh
make man
```

The compiled files can be installed with

```sh
sudo make install
```

By default, the Release build with debug info is created and no tests are
compiled. You can change that behavior by using additional options like
following:

```sh
cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
```

Note that `Debug` builds will be much slower than release build. For production
`Release` or `RelWithDebInfo` builds are recommended.

### Using the PROJ library

Osm2pgsql has builtin support for the Latlong (WGS84, EPSG:4326) and the
WebMercator (EPSG:3857) projection. If you need other projections you have to
compile with the PROJ library.

Both the older API (PROJ version 4) and the newer API (PROJ version 6.1 and
above) are supported. Usually the CMake configuration will find a suitable
version and use it automatically, but you can set the `USE_PROJ_LIB` CMake
cache variable to choose between the following behaviours:

* `4`: Look for PROJ library with API version 4. If it is not found, stop with
  error.
* `6`: Look for PROJ library with API version 6. If it is not found, stop with
  error.
* `off`: Build without PROJ library.
* `auto`: Choose API 4 if available, otherwise API 6. If both are not available
  build without PROJ library. (This is the default.)

## Using LuaJIT

To speed up Lua tag transformations, [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/) can be
optionally enabled on supported platforms. This can speed up processing
considerably.

On a Debian or Ubuntu system install the LuaJIT library:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libluajit-5.1-dev
```

Configuration parameter `WITH_LUAJIT=ON` needs to be added to enable LuaJIT.
Otherwise make and installation steps are identical to the description above.

```sh
cmake -D WITH_LUAJIT=ON ..
```

Use `osm2pgsql --version` to verify that the build includes LuaJIT support.
The output should show something like

```
Lua 5.1.4 (LuaJIT 2.1.0-beta3)
```
