# It is designed as a starting point for you to develop your own, or for 
# use where all OSM tags are in hstore.

# Deleted tags
# These are tags that are generally regarded as useless for most rendering.
# Most of them are from imports or intended as internal information for mappers
# Some of them are automatically deleted by editors.
# If you want some of them, perhaps for a debugging layer, just delete the lines.

# These tags are used by mappers to keep track of data.
# They aren't very useful for rendering.
